# InvestmentCalculator

This is practice project from a [React course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) , 
that I will try to do on my own, the refactor using guidance if needed.
It already has implemented css code, and some calculating logic, this is purely react practice focused.
